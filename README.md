### Introduction
This project works with wearable computing data. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

### The steps for the project are as follows:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### There is a codebook with this project that describes the output dataset
Codebook.md

### The tidy dataset output file is included
